- Sculpt the sound of MP3s, spotty phone calls, bitcrushers, and more.
- Inspired by the MP3 encoding process, Empy lets you control every step of its distortion algorithm.
- Discover unique and varied forms of distortion.
- Free downloads for Mac, Windows *and* Linux.
- Code is open-sourced under the GPL-3.0 license, and avaliabe right here on Github: you can build, hack, and tinker with Empy yourself. Just release your changes under the same license.

I made Empy as a part of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Oregon.
